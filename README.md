Our privacy policy will help you understand what information we collect at **Budget App Expense Tracker**, how we use it, and what choices you have.  
**Budget App Expense Tracker** is developed by **Emre Gülkanat** and is provided as a free app. By choosing to use our service, you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this policy.

## Data Security
We value your trust in providing us your personal information. To protect this data:

## Location and Device Information
While the app does not collect GPS-based location data, it may collect general device information (e.g., device model, operating system) to improve app performance and prevent fraudulent activity. This data is anonymized and cannot identify individual users.
